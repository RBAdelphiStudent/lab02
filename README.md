# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the following terms:
* object,
* class,
* instance,
* method,
* signature,
* parameter,
* type,
* state,
* source code,
* return value,
* compiler

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
* int
* String
* byte
* short
* long
* float
* double
* boolean- a data type with only two values, true and false, which is typically used as a flag to track true/false conditions
* char- a data type that stores the value of a single character, which ranges from '\u0000' to '\uffff'

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0: Int
* "hello": String
* 101: Int
* -1: Int
* true: boolean
* "33": String
* 3.1415: Float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
* To add a new field to a circle object, 

## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
* public void send(String message);

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
* public average(int variable1, int variable2){

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class. 
* The book I am currently reading is an object that is a member of the Book class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
